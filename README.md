 # Book Worm Quiz

 ![Responsive](assets/images/mockup.jpg)


 ## Purpose of the Project

 [Link to Live Site Here](https://bogdanfsd.github.io/Book-Worm/)

 Main idea was to create an webpage with interactivity using HTML, CSS, JavaScript. For this reason I picked up a topic of books. Idea of quiz straightforward to check how familiar user are with the stories of the most popular books like Harry Potter, Lord of the rings, The Great Gatsby etc.

 My questions are created by myself and will be based on the rating of the most popular/famous books either classical or moerdn one. I  picked them up    [here](https://thegreatestbooks.org/) first 10 books from the list. Fortunately I read them as well as I am kind of Book Worm. Question would be easy and covered just main line and main story of the book so even if visitor read those books loooong time ago he/she would be able to answer them.

 User will choose  one answer from 3 available options that they believe is true. After the Quiz user can see the score of how well or bad they did, with time they took to finish the quiz. Once result presented user can decide to try it one more time or leave the page.

## **UX (User Experience)**


### **Vision**

Book Worm Quiz this is easy quiz to check the knowledge of people who called themself bookworms. Quiz will ran through very famous books and will ask iser only the most famous and important parts of the story so there is no need to remember the color socks that Romeo wear while was climbind to Juliet. Although  this can give an idea if person want to re-read something again or if we are talkinf about bookworm-beginner so they can find just another good quality book to spent time with.

### **Aims**

Provide a small interactive game where reader test their memory at some great readings thet probably might read long time ago. Hope it will make some feeling when you just remember something very good that happened with you long time ago (memories from childhood etc) that pops up to your mind and you want to repeat that again. Should be easy and fun so people can re-play to upgrade their score and time about topic.

### **Audience**

Books are beyond any age and values that people might have in their mind so this quiz is for everybody who consider himself/herself as bookworm and want to test himself a bit.

##  **Design**


###  **Fonts**

I stopped my choice at [Goudy Bookletter 1911](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Goudy+Bookletter+1911?query=goudy) both for questions and answers as I really love oldschool typography and this font remind me that. As well it suits Book Worm Quiz perfectly as what could be better for bookworm than pleasent font. Please see an example:

###  **Colors**

This quiz all way long in a bit dark colors just what readers would like to have so nothing distract you (like very bright color). Each color complement each other. Black and White been first colors at my mind as we are readers seeing big part of our live in this colors. Artichoke reminds the color of the paper and Caput Mortuum just calm and relaxing color that match previous colors

### **Images**

All images I took from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/). Found background of openned book and letters in the midle complement the quiz and each other. As well creates great atmosphere that you can have only with opened book in your hand.

### **Scope**

I found best approach for creating this quiz in waterfall. Which means that I would create each element and section and check them straight away to make sure that everything linked and work correctly before going to the next section. As long as User progress though the sections the one he completed will be hidden and new one displayed. I believe this approach will help me to finish project on time and tested everything.

### **Structure**

This is 1 page quiz. I found two pages the easiest for me to progress throught the development of the quiz. At index.html I was more focused on design of welcome page and location of the elements while game-rules.html have the same style but here I spend my time on developing the structure of HTML for quiz and logic. I want to make multipl number of divs that will pops up and hide while user progress clicking on the buttons.

Everything starts from landing page where User can find the name of the Quiz and button "Start" after clicking on which it directs you to the rules where User can read and understand main rules of the quiz and another button "Play" cliking on which leads you to a quiz by itself. In the end of question will be shown sentece that User finish the quiz and if he wants he can start again. Everytime user progress to new divisions previous one will be hidden.

## **Credits**

This Milestone was super challenging for me and sometimes I was checking websites like w3School in order to find what I don't understant. Video of one particular guy helped me a lot but nothing was copy paste from there [James Q Quick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u98ROZjBWy8&list=PLDlWc9AfQBfZIkdVaOQXi1tizJeNJipEx&ab_channel=JamesQQuick) as well some tings become more understandable after [Web Dev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riDzcEQbX6k&ab_channel=WebDevSimplified).
