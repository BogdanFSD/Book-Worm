 # Book Worm Quiz

 ![](img/mock_up.png)


 ## Purpose of the Project

 Main idea was to create an webpage with interactivity using HTML, CSS, JavaScript. For this reason I picked up a topic of books. Idea of quiz straightforward to check how familiar user are with the stories of the most popular books like Harry Potter, Lord of the rings, The Great Gatsby etc.

 My questions are created by myself and will be based on the rating of the most popular/famous books either classical or moerdn one. I  picked them up    [here](https://thegreatestbooks.org/) first 10 books from the list. Fortunately I read them as well as I am kind of Book Worm. Question would be easy and covered just main line and main story of the book so even if visitor read those books loooong time ago he/she would be able to answer them.

 User will choose  one answer from 3 available options that they believe is true. After the Quiz user can see the score of how well or bad they did, with time they took to finish the quiz. Once result presented user can decide to try it one more time or leave the page.

## **UX (User Experience)**


### **Vision**

Book Worm Quiz this is easy quiz to check the knowledge of people who called themself bookworms. Quiz will ran through very famous books and will ask iser only the most famous and important parts of the story so there is no need to remember the color socks that Romeo wear while was climbind to Juliet. Although  this can give an idea if person want to re-read something again or if we are talkinf about bookworm-beginner so they can find just another good quality book to spent time with.

### **Aims**

Hope it will make some feeling when you just remember something very good that happened with you long time ago (memories from childhood etc) that pops up to your mind and you want to repeat that again. Should be easy and fun so people can re-play to upgrade their score and time about topic.

### **Audience**
